# snip

A script using [junegunn/fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
and [sharkdp/bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) to present a list of files
from a directory and dump a chosen file to stdout, for purpose of managing
small repetable snippets of text or code.

Requires (and works on any) Python 3.6 or above, as tested using
[https://github.com/FRex/anypython](https://github.com/FRex/anypython),
due to usage of [f-strings](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings).
